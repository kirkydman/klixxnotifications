Hello KLiXXers,

There is a Mini update available, I have added a proper Favourites section and tweaked 
a couple of things. Please when you run the mini update can you press ok like it asks
then press home and power off (even tho it doesnt tell you to do that). The mini update
can be found in the Klixx update section and it will take 30 seconds to do.
Im really happy with the way this build looks like its going now and the sports is going
to be a big improvement in 2017. I'll be adding lots of nice little things this year so
im very excited. Anyway run the update and as usual I am here on Facebook should you need
me on KlixxTV Facebook group. My hours now are going to be 12 till late and all weekends.

Many thanks. Kirk.
