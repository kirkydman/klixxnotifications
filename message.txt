                                  4 THINGS YOU SHOULD HAVE ON KLIXX
       If you are using a klixx box and you are not getting lots of viewing pleasure out
       of it you are doing something wrong. You should definately have all these things.
       1. The megaguide or if not the free mini megaguide.
       2. The soap search, especially the new recent soap search.
       3. The catchup, not BBC iplayer and ITV no more but very very good.
       4. Terrarium, this is without doubt the best thing for free movies and box sets.
