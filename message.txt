Good morning, afternoon, evening wherever you may be in the world,
Rumour has it that theres HD copies of Wonderwoman and Trainspotting 2 flying about in the movie
Section, try Valhalla or Maverick if you dont have these in your movie section do a full update.
If you do find them and they are working let me know so i can let everyone else know. 
Unfortunately i have a problem with my internet at the moment so i cant check, im running on
0.8mb until they come out to fix it, as you can imagine trying to do everything i do on 0.8mb
is a nightmare but amazingly i can still watch low quality films on that speed. Remember to be 
careful if you post anything on the group we dont want to lose this one too, PM me if your not
sure. Ive got some exciting stuff coming up for sports soon and i'll need a few guinea pigs.
Im talking proper logins for the proper sports apps NBC, Fox sport etc so it will need the
US VPN. Anyway im running out of space, byeeeeeeee!
