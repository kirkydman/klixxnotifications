Hello there, Just a little message from KLiXX to let you know that everything is ok apart
from Facebook shutting the group down. Im going to start sending messages on here now so
everyone can keep on top of things. The Movies and TV shows have not been great lately
due to lots of changes going on in Streaming la la land but between Specto, Exodus and
Zen you should be able to scrape thru ok, it wont last long. Dont forget about all the good
Stuff in ITV catchup and BBC. Any queries you can ask me (Kirk) on Facebook, if you cant find an
Add friend button for me just send me a message request anyway and i'll accept it.
As i said normal viewing is just back round the corner.
Thanks for your patience.
Cheers.
