Hello KLiXXters, ----------------------------13/01/2017--------------------------------------
There is a Mini-update available that will take 57 seconds to do so please dont dismiss this box as
if you get behind on your updates it will cause you aggro in the future. Its very simple to do just
click the update button attached to this box let it run and at the end press ok, then retun on your
remote then restart your KLiXX by going to the "Power off KliXX" button underneath klixx updates or
just holding down your power button, whatever! Ive added some more kids stuff for the temporary
failure of cartoon Krazy, ive added some more IPTV in live TV section. Ive also added a little 
cleaner that clears your cache and other bits for you automatically when you turn KLiXX on (you'll
see it when you restart). Actually in hindsight when you power off go to the power off KLiXX button
ive noticed some people getting disconnected from their wifi powering off like that. Anyway compet-
ition tomorrow and prizes to be won, waheeeey!
