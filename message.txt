Hi folks, ive had quite a few messages lately about the sport and whats gonna happen when the 
Premiere starts and all that, the thing is theyve been cracking right down on the sports lately
so im keeping a very low profile, ive already had one group shut down and plus there bugger all
worth watching in sports at the minute anyway. BUT if you think im not gonna bother with sport
anymore you are very much mistaken, i love my football and the competitions every weekend to 
not have sport. And ive got some nice bits coming up dont worry, so dont forget to visit my
live sports desk, thats where all the action is going to be on weekends, the address is on the
group in the pinned post in the handy links bit.
Cheers
