                                  THIS IS A KLIXX ANNOUNCEMENT
       As most of you know there is a new klixx app, if you are new to klixx you will
       probably already have it, its green thats the easiest way to tell, if you are
       still on the old black and silver one i would consider moving over. Tutorials on
       all things klixx can be found at www.tonkstv.com on our help page. We are now on 
       version 2018.7, please do not hesitate to contact either me or Ross on the group
       or by private message or phone if you have any problems. We have some new and 
       interesting stuff coming up in the near future so were looking forward to that
       but obviously we dont want to put the kiss of death on anything yet, so watch
       this space, in the meantime HAPPY VIEWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
       The KLiXX team.
