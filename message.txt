     Happy new year,

        
        Welcome to the new KLiXX build. This is built with ease of navigation in mind. If you are new then it will be nice and
        
        easy for you to use (hopefully). If youre a KLiXX veteran then it will look slightly different being theres no sub-sections
        
        (well, not many) just sections. The sport has been removed from the main guide now and is in its own section, theres lots
        
        more options for sport. Also updating will be very different now, no more long ones just mini 1 min updates (phew!)
        
        Ive put in lots of little information boxes called "click me, read me" to help you along the way so click these when you
        
        see them (if need be). Im on the group every day if you need me from Midday onwards now and all day weekends, find me on 
        
        Klixx TV Facebook group. Good luck and give me some feed back good or bad. have a great 2017!!!! Team KLiXX xxx
