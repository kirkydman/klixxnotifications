Hi Folks, 
Just a note to let you know ive set up a Website Sports forum called Sportsdesk, this is
because we cant talk about sport on the Facebook page, DEFINATELY not, sport is the main
reason of people being closed down. To find the site go to the FB group and look in the 
pinned post and theres a list of handy links there, the site being one of them. Theres 
of good games at the moment so get yourselves familiar with the site. Also im looking for
a couple of guinea pigs to test some sports app out for me, they must be able to know how
to use apps and be good at basic navigation skills, message me if your interested.
All the best
