There is a new update if you wasnt aware, its 8.1.3. Ive made a few fixes for the guide
getting rid of the foriegn channels it offers and fixing the couple of links that didnt
work, this is the mega guide by the way, the other guide is the same. The mega guide now
has over 150 channels on it and is running lovely its Â£60 for the year so if you want a 
free 48 trial on it let me know, theres over 100 new sports channels on the new IPTV it 
really is good, contact me on the group or in person for a trial.
Many thanks
