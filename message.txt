Hello KLiXXters,  -----------THIS TIME YOU CAN UPDATE-------------------
There is an update available, if youre seeing this message and everything is running ok then 
just go to the update section and run the normal update, then press ok at the end, then home 
then restart your box. If you are still getting the xmas intro you need to wipe your klixx 
and re-update (come to the group if you need help). When you restart your box again you
 will see this message again but this time it will have different buttons at the bottom, one 
will say "update box" the other will say "Dismiss" obviously then Just press the "Dismiss" 
one. The updates will then pop up automatically from now so that nobody ever misses an 
update again coz its a right pain when they do!
Restart your router before you update it will make it quicker.
                           
Many thanks. Kirk.
