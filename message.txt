Hi there,there is an update available to 3.7.0 you can mini update to this if youve been
keeping up to date with your updates, otherwise do full system update in klixx updates
or if you want to keep it nice and fresh do a clear data first and re-update, if you dont know how
to do this visit www.yellowlink.weebly.com and go to fresh install. Remember if youre up to date
with your updates you can go into maintenance ans save your favourites first. PM Kirk if you 
need any assistance.

Many thanks
