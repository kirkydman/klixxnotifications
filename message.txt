People please remember, we cannot under any circumstances talk about banned and illgegal 
addons/streams on my FB page under any circumstances, ive already had one group closed
down if this one goes thats it! If your not sure just PM me, if people continue to do this 
they will be BANNED and i really mean it, its either that or i will be closed down and
no-one will get support, THINK THINK THINK BEFORE YOU POST. If your not sure dont post
just ask, its not me moaning, Facebook picks up on keywords and detects them and close
you down its already happened once if you dont need any more proof, loose lips sink ships.
Peace.
