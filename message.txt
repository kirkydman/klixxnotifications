Hi there folks,                                                                         08/02/2017
After the big update the other day i realised that the navigation was still a bit buggy as in
sometimes trying to open TV guide opens the main menu page etc, so theres a mini update attached
to this that will fix that it will still be version 3.2.2.
On another note if you have purchased your box or my app from anyone other than me, Chris Connors,
Steve Connors, Paul and James (Brighton), Duncan (alcazares), Allan James, Dean Grayson or Chris
in Tenerife then your probably watching a copied version in which case you'll be cut off soon and
youve been ripped off, contact me if you think this has happened and i'll hook you up properly for
free, im a genuine guy and i dont like to see anyone ripped off so contact me rather than get cut
off. Its unfortunate that i have to even say this, anyway happy viewing as always.

All the best.
