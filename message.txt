                                  ITV PLAYER IS BACK!!!!!!!
       We are pleased to announc the return of BBC iplayer and ITV player, I had to do a
       complete software re-build to get round the https that BBC and ITV are now using
       but its all working again nicely but you need to download our new app, you need to
       go into maintenance in klixx, then to the RED apps for downloading, in there look
       for klixxnew click it and install it, if you dont have all this then you need to 
       update klixx first by going along to klixx updates. Once you have downloaded and
       installed klixxnew press open and it will update itself, this is so easy the app
       literally installs and updates itself you just have to press a couple of buttons.
       Once it as all done this app can be loacated in your APPS. If you are mega guide
       you will need to log in and add channels etc, thank you.
