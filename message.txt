Hi there folks,                                                                     23/01/07
There is a little update available that will take you 1 min to do so please press on the update
button below let it run then press ok then Power off (the power off button should be in there
for you now) I have brought back the yellow link in this version but theres a little twist. You
have to go to their website and run a stream from there just for one second then it will be 
activated in KLiXX for 24hrs, you can do it from your laptop or mobile as long as its on the same
wi-fi, it might sound like a bit of a pain but its worth it. Not everyone will bother to do this
so you know the streams wont be overloaded. Anyway please do the little update to version 3.1.2
oh by the way those of you that dont know what the yellow link is, its in sport.

*****************REMEMBER TO RESTART YOUR ROUTERS REGULARLY********************* All the best.
