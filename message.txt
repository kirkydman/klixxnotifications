There is a new update if you wasnt aware, its 8.0.2 and theres a few interesting things in
there most noticeably, number one you now have the ability to turn off them annoying pop ups
that sometimes appear when you want to watch a film and number two the new IPTV subscription
service. This is a paid service but is very good with over 1200 premium channels, all sky
sport, BT sport in fact every sports channel in the world virtually, all sky movies and all
the premium sky channels just everything. Its all laid out in a nice TV guide too (unlike
some providers) well not ALL because there would be too many. Theres Portuguese, French, 
Italian, Dutch basically most of the channels that exist. If you want a 48 hr trial just
get in touch with Kirk on Facebook and he'll give you a code, oh and did i mention we will
have all 3pm kick offs section for the football. Give us a shout for a trial, cheers. 
REMEMBER TO KEEP THIS LO PRO ON THE GROUP PLEASE
