Hi folks, ive added another little update today so you can get terranium TV, this is a brill
app, probably the best theres ever been. Its similar to showbox except its very remote control
freindly so no mouse needed, in fact its 10x better than showbox, to get this on your box, mini
update to 3.7.1 and go into maintenance and apps to download, then down load MX player, then 
Terrarium TV and just wait for 5 mins, then go to the button underneath that says go to file
browser, at this point they may try and install themselves in which case press install, if not
go to your download folder in file browser and install them, the whole process takes 5 mins.
Then to use Terrarium go into the movie section in KLiXX. 
Some of the newest stuff is cam so stay away from them, but you get to choose your quality as
normal, some of them say "slow" next to them, stay away from them, its a wee bit different so 
have a fiddle its well worth it.
