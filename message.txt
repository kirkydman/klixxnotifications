Hello there, --------if youve already seen this dismiss it 16/01/07---------------------

There is a Mini update ready which will take 47 secs to do, just click on the update button at the
bottom of this box, then press ok when its finished then restart your KLiXX. Please do not ignore
these little updates as they are important.I have added a cleaning device now so that all your caches
are cleared for you on startup including Exodus and Zen.

Remember these little updates take me about 10 hrs to make and only 47 seconds for you to do.

After this update you will have a power off klixx button in this dialogue box for next time, cheers.
