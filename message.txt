                                           ATTENTION!!! PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR BOX IS SITTING
                                           FLAT ON ITS SURFACE, MAKE SURE THE WIRES FROM THE
                                           BACK ARE NOT CAUSING IT TO BE LIFTED  OFF THE 
                                           SURFACE AT THE BACK, THIS WILL RESULT IN YOUR 
                                           POWER INLET BECOMING LOOSE WHERE IT GETS PUSHED
                                           DOWN, WHERE THE BOXES ARE SO SMALL AND LIGHT NOW
                                           IT IS EASY FOR THE WIRES TO RAISE THEM OFF THE 
                                           SURFACE, MAKE SURE THE WIRES AT THE BACK ARE 
                                           RUNNING OUT NICELY ALLOWING THE BOX TO SIT FLAT.
                                           THANK YOU
