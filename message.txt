                  Mega guiders!! As you know theres been a problem with the megaguide the
                  last 2 days, if you go into Live TV settings then into megaguide settings
                  and press the "my guides gone funny" button you will get the guide back,
                  it will tell you theres an error when you go to load the guide but just 
                  ignore it and press ok and it will load, this is obviously a temporary
                  fix and hope to have it done properly in the next day or so, cheers
